/**
 * Server-side enforcement of sync-owned fields on synced clusters and hosts
 * (#196, epic #172).
 *
 * A `source='vsphere'` cluster or host is reconciled from vCenter on every sync
 * pass. `VsphereSyncService` writes via Prisma directly and never calls these
 * services, so guarding here can NEVER fight the sync itself — it only refuses
 * operator API mutations that vCenter would silently overwrite (or, worse, that
 * destroy data the next sync then resurrects empty: deleting a synced cluster
 * cascades away its baseline history and the next pass re-creates a hollow twin
 * under the same `(connectionId, externalId)`).
 *
 * The refusal is a stable `SYNC_OWNED_FIELD` 409 — a state conflict, not a
 * malformed payload, so `ConflictError` (409) rather than `UnprocessableError`
 * (422). The error steers the operator at the vCenter connection settings
 * generally; there is deliberately no reference to a detach action, which does
 * not exist yet.
 *
 * @ai-note This guard is FIELD-AWARE, never route-blanket. Operator-owned
 * surfaces on synced entities are deliberately left open and MUST stay that way:
 *   - label (`name`) / description / thresholds — operator-owned; `name` is
 *     pinned via `nameIsCustom`, not rejected.
 *   - `commissionedAt` / `commissionedAtProvisional` — the #194 confirm flow.
 *   - `appendCapacity` — sync writes no HostMetricCapacity rows yet (#198), so it
 *     is the operator's only path to give a synced cluster any capacity; guarding
 *     it now would strand every synced cluster at capacity 0 forever.
 *   - archive/unarchive and lifecycle transitions — sync never writes those.
