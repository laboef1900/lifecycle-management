 * No credential, no request body — the socket is opened, the chain is read, and
 * the socket is destroyed. Every credential-bearing path MUST instead use
 * `ca: [pinnedRootPem]` with `rejectUnauthorized: true` (see `verifiedTlsOptions`).
 *
 * @ai-warning Do NOT "improve" this by moving the trust check into
 * `checkServerIdentity`. That callback fires **only when OpenSSL chain
 * verification SUCCEEDS** — it is gated on `verifyError` being empty, not on
 * `rejectUnauthorized`. Measured on Node 26.5.0: against an untrusted certificate
 * with `rejectUnauthorized: false`, it is invoked **zero** times while the
 * connection proceeds. A thumbprint check placed there never runs, and every
 * connection silently succeeds against any certificate — code that reads as
 * pinned but is `curl -k`, with green tests. (govmomi does do TOFU in
 * `checkServerIdentity`'s Go equivalent, `VerifyPeerCertificate`, which DOES run
 * on verification failure. Node has no equivalent. The model does not port.)

 * service-account password on **every scheduled poll**, on the happy path, with
 * no anomaly to detect and no interaction with our API.
 *
 * Pin the chain's ROOT as a `ca:` anchor rather than checking a leaf thumbprint
 * in application code:
 *   - it fails closed **in OpenSSL**, so there is no app-layer check to forget,
 *     skip, or refactor away;
 *   - hostname verification comes back for free, because the chain now validates,
 *     so the binding is "a cert for THIS host, issued by THIS CA" rather than a
 *     bare fingerprint;
 *   - it survives vCenter's unattended leaf auto-renewal (~2 years), whereas a
 *     leaf pin breaks by itself on a timer and trains admins to click through
 *     mismatches — which is how pinning dies in practice.
 *
 * @ai-warning Pinning the LEAF via `ca:` does not work against a chain-presenting
 * server: OpenSSL must terminate at a self-signed anchor it trusts, and a trusted
 * leaf mid-chain does not terminate it (`SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`; Node does not
 * expose `X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN`). An implementer who tries `ca: [leafPem]`
 * will watch it fail against real vCenter and be tempted to "fix" it with
 * `rejectUnauthorized: false`. Pin the root.
